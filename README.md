# Advocate

Advocate generates websites, saving you from HTML, depression, and baldness.

 - static site, so deployment be easy
 - from dev to dev... fear not.
 - share components


## QuickStart

It's easy:

1. Preview the advocate templates.

2. Generate the template's config folder.

3. Start a live-preview in your browser to see the changes as you make them.

4. Configure the layout. (web-page title, icon, branding features, etc.)

5. Configure each Page.

6. Save the generated webpage! (with html, css, js, images, etc.)

7. Deploy wherever you like! (github pages perhaps?)


## Does your website ride the Mammoth?

Mammoth is a malleable router used for mesh networking, privacy & security (ex. runs cryptocurrency wallets), and bridging 'fragmented internets' such as Tor, Maidsafe, Freenet, etc.

Mammoth deploys pages to multiple internets, **multiplying** its audience, and **immortalizing it** in distributed networks.

Mammoth + Advocate = MAX Vol.
