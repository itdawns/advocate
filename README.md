# Advocate

Advocate generates websites, saving you from HTML, depression, and baldness.

###How is Advocate [different](https://quip.com/tGHSAacpcntb) from the other 10,000 static page generators?

## Vision

Advocate is all about enabling participation in the global connected society. Today, people already share ideas,  information, teach, imagine, find creative synergy and do amazing things using the web. Almost universally, these same people have  great difficulty  creating a web presence that truly lives up to the one that they've created for themselves in their mind.  Advocate solves this problem by treating web site creation as a learning process for the user, empowering them to build their dreams.  

## Advocate does some handy stuff:

 - generates pages
 - content creators and designers work with understandable components, not HTML/CSS/JS.
 - one place for styles, one place for content
 - static sites = highly compatible deployment processes & cheap hosting
 - pluggable component system enabling "rip, mix and burn" for web content and configuration


### QuickStart

3 easy ways to use Advocate:

 - Purchase [Fenix](https://www.facebook.com/fenixhw) loaded with the Advocate image
 - Use your Raspberry Pi or other single board general purpose computer, loaded with an advocate image
 - Install [io.js](iojs.org) on your home PC and use it to manually deploy a page 

## Does your website ride the Mammoth?  How about a Fenix?

Mammoth deploys pages to multiple internets, **multiplying** your content's reach, and **immortalizing your content** by automatically leveraging distributed networks.
