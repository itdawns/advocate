## Vision

Advocate is all about enabling participation in the global connected society. Today, people already share ideas,  information, teach, imagine, find creative synergy and do amazing things using the web. Almost universally, these same people have  great difficulty  creating a web presence that truly lives up to the one that they've created for themselves in their mind.  Advocate solves this problem by treating web site creation as a learning process for the user, empowering them to build their dreams.

Buying the [Hard-App](http://hardapps.itdawns.org) on a Router or TV-Stick supports Dawn.

Mammoth deploys pages to multiple internets, **multiplying** your content's reach, and **immortalizing your content** by automatically leveraging distributed networks.

Mammoth + Advocate = MAX Vol.
