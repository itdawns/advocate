# Advocate

Advocate does some handy stuff:

 - generates pages
 - content creators and designers work with understandable components, not HTML/CSS/JS.
 - one place for styles
 - static site, so deployment be easy
 - from dev to dev... fear not.
 - share components


## QuickStart

It's easy:

1. Preview the advocate templates.

2. Generate the template's config folder.

3. Start a live-preview in your browser to see the changes as you make them.

4. Configure the layout. (web-page title, icon, branding features, etc.)

5. Configure each Page.

6. Save the generated webpage! (with html, css, js, images, etc.)

7. Deploy wherever you like! (github pages perhaps?)
